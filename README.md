Program which models the semi-random movement of nth dimensional points in nth dimensional toroidal space.

Points can have attractive or repulsive behaviors relative to one another.

Closer points have stronger attraction, points further have weaker attraction.

When points exceed a certain threshold, the value wraps around, simulating toroidal space.

"Animates" by showing points and coordinates in progressive graphs, with steps determined by input.

  User defined parameters: Attraction behavior and strength can be defined by user. 
  Random seed can be defined by user. 
  Size of coordinate space can be defined by user.
  Average step size of points can be defined by user.
  Steps per cycle can be defined by user.
  Steps per 'frame' of animation must be defined by user.
